summary.csv gives the execution time relative to O3 for each benchmark when run
with its predicted configuration.

nn-distances.csv shows the nearest neighbour for each benchmark and the
euclidean distance between the normalised feature vector for their most time
consuming functions.

In addition, the sub-directory for each benchmark gives its raw execution time
when run with i) O3 and ii) its predicted configuration (see O3.csv and
predicted.csv)
